Celebrity Sponsor
Schools for India plans to sign-on celebrities of global recognition, who would be committed to the project for a period of 15 years.

These celebrities will nurture the membership of a specific cluster and constantly interact with the various entities of the organizational structure. They will also participate in the annual activities of the cluster.

Further, these celebrities are not expected to contribute monetarily; but shall act as the central driving force to ensure the overall success of the project.

Each District/cluster will have one Celebrity Sponsor. Such Celebrities will interact on a regular basis with the Schools for India members.

They will take active part in acquiring new members for the cluster as well as supporting the building and running of the schools.

The celebrity sponsor will be in touch with the members of a cluster through e-mail and will participate in virtual meetings every quarter.
